## Work/Project Exmples
1. Chat App -> This was a solo project I built during my time at Juno. It was my first React project, so there was a lot of “learning as you go,” but I loved building it! I used firebase for email/password authentication, and to make user data persistent. I integrated a third-party emoji picker, which required quite a bit of documentation reading and fiddling with configurations to get it to work in my app. I also included an API call to the Giphy API to allow the user to send GIFs. I have started learning about Redux, and I want to incorporate it into my Chat App to make data flow between components easier!

2. Game of Potter -> This was a group project built during my time at Juno. We were a group of four, and one of the biggest take-aways from the project was learning to code as a team; compromising on ideas, divvying up the workload and managing time as a team, learning to read and work with other people’s code, and collaborating through GitHub. We were assigned to work with a “client” that was looking to have a specific web app created. Our project was a friendship dating app between two sets of fictional characters. The goal was to show the user how two characters from separate fictional worlds would match up together, based on a set of compatibility criteria. We used React and several API’s to achieve this. For myself, I was in charge of creating the component that grabbed characters from the different APIs and randomly selecting one for each side, and then displayed them to the page.

3. Data Visualization App -> My most recent project was a full-stack application for visualizing data graphically. This was a solo project that I worked on for a technical test. I built it using React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL. Prior to this project I had not worked with the back-end before, I had to learn all the server-side technologies and then implement them within a short amount of time. In order to accomplish this I read lots of articles and watched lots of instructional videos, and in the end, I had a working live full-stack application! Although I did not move forward with the specific company, I did learn a lot, and gained several new skills!

## Inspiration
1. I recently read an article about [regex](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/regular-expressions-demystified-regex-isnt-as-hard-as-it-looks-617b55cf787/) from FreeCodeCamp, and it inspired me to learn more and play around with it. I love how specific you can get when looking for a particular pattern in strings. Now I love using it whenever I find a use-case for it!

2. I recently checked out Sarah Drasner’s [portfolio](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/)/[codepen page](https://codepen.io/sdras/) and found them to be quite inspiring (she has so many awesome open source projects). Her portfolio header is very cool! Specifically, it makes me want to get better at Canvas and web animations!

3. A little while back I came across [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), I found it super interesting and it definitely inspired me to start thinking more deeply about machine learning, and how it is applied in the digital landscape.  


## Focus
Recently I have been super interested in AI, and more specifically machine learning. AI can be applied to digital technology to better understand and predict customer interactions. I would love to build an application that allows me to learn and the incorporate some form of machine learning. To start I would spend some time learning more about the key concepts, then I would base the project timeline off of the basic tasks that would need to be completed. Based on what I’ve read so far, I would need to create an algorithm that represents the targeted process, once I know what key variables are involved, I would need to acquire a large amount of sample data, and then “train” the algorithm so that it can learn how to perform that desired task (run the sample data through the algorithm, allowing it to optimize itself through continuous self-modification).
